# Basic Onshape CAD
This is a repository for my CAD projects.

## Caster Base

### Reflection
This project was not very difficult. It was the first project I have completed using the OnShape program for the curriculum and am looking forward to continuing to use OnShape for the rest of the year!

## Caster Mount

### Reflection
This project was very quick and simple. It gave my more practice creating and extruding sketches, as well as using linear patters. I did not run into any trouble while doing this part. 

## Caster Fork

### Reflection
This project was again quite quick and simple. The intructions were less of a step by step walkthrough which I liked because it allowed me to have to think back to what I've learned and find things for myself instead of being able to rely on a set of intructions. I did not have any trouble while completing this part and found it to be quite fun.

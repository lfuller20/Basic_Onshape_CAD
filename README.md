# Basic Onshape CAD
This is a repository for my CAD projects.

## Caster Base

### Reflection
This project was not very difficult. It was the first project I have completed using the OnShape program for the curriculum and am looking forward to continuing to use OnShape for the rest of the year!

## Caster Mount

### Reflection
This project was very quick and simple. It gave my more practice creating and extruding sketches, as well as using linear patters. I did not run into any trouble while doing this part. 

## Caster Fork

### Reflection
This project was again quite quick and simple. The intructions were less of a step by step walkthrough which I liked because it allowed me to have to think back to what I've learned and find things for myself instead of being able to rely on a set of intructions. I did not have any trouble while completing this part and found it to be quite fun.

## Caster Tire

### Reflection
This project was quick and easy but some parts of it were somewhat tricky. The dimensions of the trapezoid confused me at first but after looking at the first diagram that explained to me what to click I understood it all. I'm looking forward to finishing my Caster soon.
